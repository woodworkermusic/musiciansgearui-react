            Welcome to The Gear Registry!
            <br />
            <br />
            There's an old saying - "Don't know what you've got until it's gone."&nbsp;&nbsp;It's applicable in nearly every walk of life.
            <br />
            <br />
            It's no different with your music gear.&nbsp;&nbsp;The acoustic guitar you got for Christmas as a teenager.&nbsp;&nbsp;The violin you took to 
            lessons for years - and then used it to audition for a position in a local orchestra.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amplifier that rattles the garage 
            when you turn it up to 11.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then one day someone decides they want that gear - and you're not a willing partner in the transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have
            purchase paperwork?&nbsp;&nbsp;Photos that include identifying marks?&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial number?
            <br />
            <br />
            Why wait until it's been ripped off by some dirtbag before you scramble to figure out what to do?
            <br />
            <br />
            Register your gear here at The Gear Registry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if that day ever comes, you can sign in to your account, and with a few clicks be able to report an
            incident on your gear - which can be looked up by a potential buyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            You'll be able to put in that valuable information that can be researched by
            a potential buyer to determine whether they're getting a great deal - or stolen property.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also, if you sell that sweet sounding accordion or banjo, you can 
            complete a gear transfer online so there is record of it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Gear buyers - stop worrying about whether that vintage looking electric guitar is hotter than an Arizona highway in summer!
